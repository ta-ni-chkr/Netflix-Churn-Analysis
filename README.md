## Project Background

Netflix, established in 1997, has evolved from a DVD rental service into a global streaming powerhouse with over 300 million subscribers across 190+ countries. However, with the streaming landscape becoming increasingly competitive, understanding churn dynamics — the rate at which subscribers cancel or discontinue their service — has become essential for improving retention and strengthening user loyalty.

This project focuses on performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to examine the underlying churn patterns among Netflix users, based solely on this demo dataset. By looking at user demographics, subscription details, and engagement indicators, the analysis uncovers key trends and behaviours that may help explain the potential reasons for user drop-off.
